## Technologies used to make the Canvas:

## Bugs
- The undo and redo button are not properly working at the moment. They are some instances where they able to undo and redo the first element that was drawn.
- The audio at the load of the website plays only sometimes which needs to be fixed.
- There is a bit of an offsetwidth problem but that is only noticable when you shrink the brush size.
